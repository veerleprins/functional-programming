# Functional Programming
## :black_nib: Description
This repo shows a visualization based on a concept on the theme 'Cars in the city'. This visualization answers the main question:
**What about parking an electric car compared to parking as a disabled person in the Netherlands?**
In order to be able to visualize this main question, several subquestions have been created. You can find these in my [wiki](https://github.com/veerleprins/functional-programming/wiki/Concept)

### hypothesis
*I think there are more electric charging points available than there are disabled parking spaces.*
