## :black_nib: Description
This repo shows a visualization based on a concept on the theme 'Cars in the city'. This visualization answers the main question:
**What about charging an electric car while parking in public car parks in different provinces in the Netherlands?**
In order to be able to visualize this main question, several subquestions have been created.
1. How many electric cars are there in the Netherlands?
2. Where are public parking facilities for charging an electric car in the Netherlands?
3. How many charging stations are available per public parking space?
